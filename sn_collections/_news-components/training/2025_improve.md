What scientific computing training do you need? The SCINet Office's goal is to provide training opportunities and resources that meet the needs of ARS researchers, so we would be grateful if you could [complete our short training request form](https://forms.office.com/g/x0VzQV39Xp) and let us know how we can best help you learn the computing skills you need. Your feedback will help us decide where we should focus our efforts over the next year and beyond.  

Training opportunities are continually being updated on the [SCINet Upcoming Events webpage](/training/events/). For more information on any of the above trainings, registration questions, or suggestions, please email [SCINet-training@usda.gov](mailto:SCINet-training@usda.gov).

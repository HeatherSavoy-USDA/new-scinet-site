To maintain the performance and security of our SCINet-X circuits across ARS, we will be performing routine network maintenance at sites with SCINet-X connections.

During a Location's assigned maintenance window, the café machine(s) at the Location will be intermittently disconnected from SCINet for up to an hour as the maintenance work is completed.  
 
This work will not affect access to SCINet from your desktop or laptop computer.  **Only SCINet access from café machines will be interrupted.**  This work will not affect jobs running on Atlas or Ceres.  

If you have any questions or concerns about this maintenance, please reach out to the SCINet team at [SCINet@usda.gov](mailtto:SCINet@usda.gov).

To minimize overall impact, sites will be updated during an assigned two-hour maintenance window as indicated below:

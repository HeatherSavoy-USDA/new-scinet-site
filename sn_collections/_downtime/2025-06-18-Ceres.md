Ceres cluster maintenance is scheduled for June 18-20, 2025.

During the first day a thermal stress test will be performed to verify cooling capacity of the data center.

During the maintenance, in addition to regular tasks, the VRSC will replace remaining old ceres19 nodes with the new nodes, greatly increasing compute and memory capacity of the cluster.

As a reminder, after the maintenance the legacy community partitions on Ceres will no longer be available. Jobs are to be submitted into ceres partition.

Queued jobs will not start if they cannot complete by 8 AM CDT on June 18. In the output of the squeue command, the reason for those jobs not yet starting will state (ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance). The jobs will start after the scheduled outage completes.

The Atlas cluster will be available during the Ceres maintenance. We strongly suggest copying data from Ceres to Atlas or Juno **prior to the maintenance** if you plan to continue working through the maintenance. Once maintenance has started, we will not be able to move your data.

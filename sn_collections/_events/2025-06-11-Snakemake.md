[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is a popular workflow management tool that can help organize, document, scale, run, and reproduce your workflows. Snakemake workflows are described via a human-readable, Python-based language, and can be integrated into SCINet high-performance computing (HPC) clusters via Slurm and Conda. 

In this workshop, Aaron Yerke (SCINet/AI-COE fellow) will introduce the basics of a Snakemake workflow and demonstrate how to run it on a SCINet cluster. After attending this workshop, you should be able to integrate Snakemake into your own projects on SCINet HPC clusters.

In this workshop, participants will work through a complete RNA-seq analysis using SCINet’s Galaxy interface.<!--excerpt--> Participants will learn how to create workflows in Galaxy to:  
* Upload and process RNA-seq data.
* Perform quality control, alignment, and expression quantification.
* Identify differentially expressed genes using DESeq2.  

We will also explore ways in which you can share your history and workflows with other SCINet users in Galaxy and how it can be a powerful tool for collaborations.
